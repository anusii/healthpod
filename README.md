# Health Pod

The Health Pod collects into one private and secure location all of
your health data and medical records. You then decide if you want to
share that data with anyone else.

## Milestones

1. Basic Icon-Based GUI
2. Daily entry of Blood Pressure
3.

## Design Goals

The app works well on a desktop, web browsers, or on a mobile phone or
tablet.

For desktop there is a left hand menu whereas for phone it becomes a
pop out menu.

The menu items include:

+ Obs (A feature to record daily or regular observations like
  blood pressure, physical activity, etc)

+ Activity (A record of activities recording date, start, end, what)

+ Diary (A record of visits to doctors, dentists, pharmacy,
  vaccinations, etc. Each diary entry records: date, what, details,
  provider, professional, total, covered, cost)

+ Docs (A file browser type of thing where the user can arrange their
  PDFs into appropriate folders as they like.)

## Use Cases

+ I am visiting the doctor and I need to check when I last had a
  vaccination

+ A LLM model runs over the whole contents of the Pod to then allow me
  to interact with the data collection.
